     * @class Neuron
     * @details This class represent a single neuron that simulate the Brunel's network.
     * Each network has certain specific members describing its behaviour and what happens when 
     * a spike occured or a spike is received. 
     * Every neuron is connected with other neuron and each neuron receives a total of 1000 excitatory connection
     * and 250 inhibitory connections. The connections are created randomly. 
     * Moreover, each neuron receives some random external input from the rest of the brain. Those random
     * spikes are generated by a poisson generator. 
     * The membrane potential of the neuron is updated at the end of each time step of the simulation.
     * When it cross a certain threshold, the neruon spikes and sends the amplitude of the spike to all
     * its target neurons. 
     * Each neuron enters in refractory time for a certain period after it spikes, and then start incrising
     * its membrane potential again.
     * The neurons are devided in excitatory and inhibitory neurons: the excitatory ones send 
     * positive amplitudes to the targets, the inhibitory ones negative amplitudes.
